    1.Create an input field (in App component) with a change listener which outputs the length
    of the entered text below (e.g. in a paragraph)

    2. Create a new component (=>Validation component) which receives the text length as prop

    3. Inside the validation Component either output 'Text too short' or 'Text long enough' 
    depending on the text length (e.g. min length = 5)
    
    4. Create another component (=>Char component) and style it as inline box (display:inline-block)

    5. Render a list of char components where each CharComponent receives a different letter of the
    entered text (the initial input field) as a prop

    6. When you click a char component, it should be removed from the entered text (2 way bind)
