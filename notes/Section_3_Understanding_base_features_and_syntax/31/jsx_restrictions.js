/*
    className is used in JSX instead of class because class is a reserved word in JS
        *when the element is rendered, className becomes 'class' in the DOM

    same for htmlFor (instead of for)

    our JSX expression must have a parent root element
        *there are exceptions but best practice is to have 1 parent element/component
