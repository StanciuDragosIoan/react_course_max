/*
    stateful vs stateless component

    a stateful component manages state (either class based or through hooks)

    a stateless component (has no internal state management and only receives props)

    good practice = create as many dumb/stateless/presentational components as possible

    stateful components are also called smart components or container components
        we only want a couple of these components

    This makes app easier to maintain (clear flow of data )
        it s clear where data sits/how it changes, etc...
