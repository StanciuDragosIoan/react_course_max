        it holds the file we can edit (the script files are in the 'src')

        index.html (normal HTML page and the app entrypoint)
            the #root id div is where we mount the react app

        manifest.json file is used for metadata about our app


    the 'src' folder
        contains the actual react application

        index.js file is the entry point for the app (accesses the #root div)

        App.js contains the default app component
