/*
    Decided state and how it should be managed

    State:

        ingredients
            { meat: 1, cheese: 2, }

        purchase: true/false

        total price


    State will be managed in the burger builder

        # BurgerBuilder should be a stateful container component
        
        # all the other components can be stateless
